# Genderstanding
My goal in creating Genderstanding is to provide a space to discuss gender identity in a positive manner and increase understanding in a space that is traditional marked by conflict.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (EJS, Express), MongoDB

Genderstanding is built on a stack that includes EJS. This will likely eventually change to a more traditional MERN stack and include React to capture benefits of component-based modularity as I work with end-user feedback. In its current iteration, Genderstanding represents a more robust "wireframe" of an app that provides functionality and flexibility to both users and support.

## Optimizations

My current to-do list:
- Likes per user: for example, upvotes and downvotes? Various other reactions?
- Flesh out header sections -- many of the styling elements need to be optimized.
-   Profile settings
-   About
-   Donate
-   FAQ
- OAuth only from Google/FB for better accountability of users.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first project to fully utilize Tailwind CSS and also includes some EJS functionality that I have not placed into any project before. Because of the sensitive nature surrounding Gender Identity, I am choosing to use Passport.JS to lean on OAuth from other entities to increase user accountability. Overall, the project has been a great exercise on an industry-standard stack and lends itself well to my own life experiences. If I were to start this project over, I would probably write this in React from the get-go.
