# Genderstanding
My goal in creating Genderstanding is to provide a space to discuss gender identity in a positive manner and increase understanding in a space that is traditional marked by conflict.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (EJS, Express), MongoDB

Genderstanding is built on a stack that includes EJS. This will likely eventually change to a more traditional MERN stack and include React to capture benefits of component-based modularity as I work with end-user feedback. In its current iteration, Genderstanding represents a more robust "wireframe" of an app that provides functionality and flexibility to both users and support.

## Optimizations

My current to-do list:
- Likes per user: for example, upvotes and downvotes? Various other reactions?
- Flesh out header sections -- many of the styling elements need to be optimized.
-   Profile settings
-   About
-   Donate
-   FAQ

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
